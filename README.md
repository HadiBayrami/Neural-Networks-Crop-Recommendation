A deep learning model that recommends the optimal crop based on soil and weather conditions.

## Features

- Preprocesses agricultural data (N, P, K levels, temperature, humidity, etc.)
- Neural network with dropout layers to prevent overfitting
- Achieves 96% accuracy on test data
- Provides easy-to-use prediction interface
 - Comprehensive model evaluation metrics
- Clean, modular codebase

## Installation

1. Clone the repository:
```bash
