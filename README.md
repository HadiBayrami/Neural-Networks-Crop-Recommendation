A neural network-based system for recommending optimal crops based on soil and environmental parameters.

## Features

- Preprocesses agricultural data (N, P, K levels, temperature, humidity, etc.)
- Implements a multi-layer perceptron for classification
- Achieves 96% accuracy on test data
- Provides easy-to-use prediction interface

## Installation

1. Clone the repository:
```bash
git clone https://github.com/HadiBayrami/crop-recommendation-nn.git
cd crop-recommendation-nn
